🧙‍♀️ A Redux action and reducer set to manage Entities and Components

Meant to be used in tandem with Wild Magic, but could be used as a state manager for any ECS

## Status

⚠ Alpha! ⚠ Just like Wild Magic, the nature of this code is ever-shifting!

## Development

I recommend using docker, as you can get set up without having to worry about any dependencies, except for docker itself.

### With Docker

Make sure you have already installed both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- Install: `make install`
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `make test`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Generate Documentation: `make documentation`

### With Node.js

- Install: `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Generate Documentation: `npm run documentation`
